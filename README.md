Repository containing all files related to PCC Syntax highlighting in numerous code editors/programs.

# Notepad++

Fortunately, Notepad++ is very easy to work with in terms of custom user-defined languages. So I was able to put this together very quickly. The installation process is very simple aswell.

Instructions:
- Download the "NotepadSyntaxHighlighting.xml" file from the git repo.
- Open Notepad++
- Go to the "Language" tab on the top bar along the window, then scroll down to "Define Your Language". This should open up a new window.
- In this new window, Look for the "import" button, now press it and open the NotepadSyntaxHighlighting.xml file.
- Now you can close this window, and if you go back into the "Language" tab, when you scroll to the bottom, "Mc Command Language" should be there, select it and now you can code freely with the wonders of syntax highlighting!
