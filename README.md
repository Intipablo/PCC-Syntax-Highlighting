# Notepad++

Fortunately, Notepad++ is very easy to work with in terms of custom user-defined languages. So I was able to put this together very quickly. The installation process is very simple aswell.

Instructions:
- Download the "Notepad++SyntaxHighlighting" file from the git repo.
- Open Notepad++
- Go to the "Language" tab on the top bar along the window, then scroll down to "Define Your Language". This should open up a new window.
- In this new window, Look for the "import" button, now press it and open the Notepad++SyntaxHighlighting file.
